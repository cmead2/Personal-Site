  <h1>Things I'm Into</h1>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Composing Music</li>
      <ul>
        <li>I love the tactical feel of writing on staff paper. Clarinet sonatas and pop songs alike
          are such productions I'd love to see in a pool of a future many
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>Global Sustainability</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Environmentally-informed decisions are the right decisions. If I found myself in a pool of wealth,
          I feel confident that I'd invest in as many diverse efforts to protect the planet, demand social equity,
          and learn how we can live better for each other and for the entire world
        </li>
      </ul>
    <li>Comedy</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Oh good gravy, do I love a good heehee-haha. It is true and I am thankful for my retention of such
        youthful levity
        </li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
